<h3 align = "center"> <u> Favorite Problems From CF 2020 </u> </h3>
<p>
2020 was an eventful year for competitive programming for me, especially on CodeForces.
</p>
<p>
In terms of rating, I have accumulated a maximum rating of 2499 and have reached the title Grandmaster and International Master during the 2nd half of the year and was a stable Master for the 1st half of the year.
Compared to 2019, where I initially dropped from Candidate Master to Expert and later stayed at Master, I am very satisfied with my rating progress in 2020.
</p>
<p>
As for submissions, I have made 2220 submissions and among them, I solved 655 problems. Also, I participated in 24 contest officially on Codeforces.
</p>
<p>
The primary reason that I wanted to write this blog is to share some of my favorite problems that I solved on Codeforces in 2020.
When thinking about what were my favorite problems of the year I accounted for the impact it had on me and the elegance of the solution.
There were simply too many problems that I enjoyed solving this year, but I managed to compile a list of 37 problems and cut it down to the 10 best problems.
First I'll list in the order I solved them in for the honorable mention problems that made it to the 37 problem cut and then I will show and explain the best 9.

Those were the best of the best Codeforces problems that I encountered in 2020. There are other good problems that I solved which can be found on <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oSdfTQ-INKlECFJQB2b2itkipiYKwj8T0UEnlcBykM4/edit#gid=0">my problem list</a>.
As an ending note, for 2021, I hope to regain my confidence to compete in contests again to achieve greater heights and continue to be enlighted by the problems and community.
