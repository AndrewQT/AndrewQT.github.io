title: Favorite Problems From CF 2020
---

2020 was an eventful year for competitive programming for me, especially on CodeForces.

In terms of rating, I have accumulated a maximum rating of 2499 and have reached the title Grandmaster and International Master during the 2nd half of the year and was a stable Master for the 1st half of the year.
Compared to 2019, where I initially dropped from Candidate Master to Expert and later stayed at Master, I am very satisfied with my rating progress in 2020.

As for submissions, I have made 2220 submissions and among them, I solved 655 problems. Also, I participated in 24 contest officially on Codeforces.

The primary reason that I wanted to write this blog is to share some of my favorite problems that I solved on Codeforces in 2020.
When thinking about what were my favorite problems of the year I accounted for the impact it had on me and the elegance of the solution.
There were simply too many problems that I enjoyed solving this year, but I managed to compile a list of 37 problems and cut it down to the 10 best problems.
First I'll list in the order I solved them in for the honorable mention problems that made it to the 37 problem cut and then I will show and explain the best 11.
